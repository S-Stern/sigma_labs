Global scope:
    The largest domain of a file, accessible by all functions within it unless naming issues arise 
    (i.e. unless within a given local scope a global variable name is defined without using the global keyword). 
    In python, variables can be declared globally using the global keyword, or by declaring them outside of any function.
    Global variables can only be modified within functions by using the global keyword.


Local scope:
    The local scope is the domain of the relevant function. 
    This will be smaller than global scope unless the entire file is a single function.
    Local scope can be expanded using the global and nonlocal keywords.
