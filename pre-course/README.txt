This consists of files completed as requested for Sigma Labs' pre-course.
The files are organised as follows:
    The folders L1-L4 denote the levels.
    Within the folders, each file is named x-y.py.
    These should be read Challenge x: Task y.
    Where y consists of two or more digits, n1, n2, ..., nm it should be read Tasks n1, n2, ..., nm.
