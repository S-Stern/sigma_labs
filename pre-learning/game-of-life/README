Welcome to my implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
This is a lightweight implementation of the game, relying on python's rich file for display.

In order to run the game you must have rich installed.
If you do not, it is advisable to set up a virtual environment using venv, the installing it using pip within your environment.
Once you have pip installed and accessable, simply execute 'python game.py' in your terminal.
Congratulations! You ran your first game of life.

In order to edit the starting conditions, you will need to look at the 'config' file.
This file containsthe five named perameters which dictate the game's starting conditions, which are listed below, along with their default values:
display-height: 30 #this contains the height of the board
display-width: 30 #this dictates the width of the board
refresh-rate: 2 #this dictates the number of times that the board will progress every second
seed: ./seeds/10cellinfinitegrowth.cells #this dictates which cells are living at the start of the game; see further details below
If these perameters are incorrectly named, the program will not read them, and will default to the above-given values.
Most are self explanitory, but seed requires some explaination:
The value given should be the path to a file with the extension ".cells"
For an example of these files, have a look at the contents of ./seeds/example.cells
